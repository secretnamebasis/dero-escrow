dero-escrow is a work in progress to make escrow services private

As this is desc is my first smart contract, I will need to lean heavily on the work of Capt DERO and the documentation that he wrote here: https://github.com/deroproject/documentation. Specifically, I believe that his documentation on an asset exchange service will be key.
